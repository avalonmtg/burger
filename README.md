Burger

I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). I followed the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

Try Burgers from Different States! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger has been eaten. This will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
